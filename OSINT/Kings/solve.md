### Kings : Osint


**Clues:**

- A photograph of a dagger/knife.
- The title "Kings" in plural, suggesting the challenge will involve multiple kings.
- The statement:
  - "cosmic weapons"
  - "example of such weapons on the net"
  - "This ruler's court artist"
  - "drew the most accurate painting of a now extinct bird"

**Approach:**

1. **Reverse Image Search:**
   - A reverse image search reveals that this dagger, made of cosmic materials, belonged to Tutankhamun, an Egyptian king.

2. **Research on the Extinct Bird:**
   - Referring to the clues, we search for which bird has gone extinct from Earth. We quickly discover it is the dodo.

3. **Research on the Court Artist:**
   - Next, we need to find a dodo that was painted by an artist from a king or emperor's court. We find a painting of a dodo by Ustad Mansur, an artist from Emperor Jahangir's court.
   - Further research shows that this emperor also possessed a dagger made of cosmic materials, which perfectly matches the challenge's statement.

4. **Location of the Painting:**
   - We then search for where this painting is kept. It is displayed at the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
   - A quick search on Google Maps helps to find the museum's coordinates.

5. **Challenge Validation:**
   - Even after finding the coordinates, the flag did not work. A quick discussion with an administrator helped me find the correct flag and validate the challenge.
